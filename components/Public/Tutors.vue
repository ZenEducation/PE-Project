      <template v-slot:comment>My NEET performance would not have been possible without them! Their Early Completion of
        Syllabus Strategy enabled me to revise the entire syllabus more than 5 to 6 times, which was not possible for
        other students that I know from other institutes, as their syllabus was completed just 3 to 4 months before the
        NEET exam, in which case revision would not at all be possible for any student.<NuxtLink to="#">See More...

      <template v-slot:comment>The one to one teaching and mentoring methodology helped me in a great way. It allowed the professors to monitor my progress at each step. I received feedback pertaining to my areas of improvement and not just some general feedback that is applicable to everyone. That helped me immensely to focus on my weak areas and strengthen them with time. <NuxtLink to="#">See More...
