                            one of the biggest advantages by
                            giving me 2 years of time only for practice, revision and test series enabling me to constantly
                            improve my scores. The Full Syllabus Tests helped me understand the concepts that I had

                            with time and also the topics and chapters in which I need to practice more. The professors
                            clarified all my NEET doubts from time to time, making my revision and practice process
                            effective
                            and efficient. Paathshala’s Mistakes Analysis’ Report has been an amazing tool in helping me
                            find
                            out topics and chapters, where I needed more practice and revision. I have given 200 to 250 NEET
                            Full Syllabus Tests. Solving these many FSTs greatly improved my time management skills and also
                            my
                            ability to stay calm and confident in an exam environment

                        the teachers was the cherry on the cake. Our senior students also gave us the information about the
                        mighty class in our 11 Standard. I was also given the right guidance about the books to be referred
                        to, in addition to the study materials provided. I would rest my case on a final note that, if
                        Paathshala is given the opportunity to compete at the higher level, it would gain all the honors and
