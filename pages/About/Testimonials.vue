          "paragraph1": "A huge thank you to Paathshala and Photon Ecademy. My NEET performance would not have been possible without them! Their Early Completion of Syllabus Strategy enabled me to revise the entire syllabus more than 5 to 6 times, which was not possible for other students that I know from other institutes, as their syllabus was completed just 3 to 4 months before the NEET exam, in which case revision would not at all be possible for any student",
          "paragraph2": "Also, their one to one, extensively personalized teaching played an important role not only in effective teaching but also in completing the syllabus early, since it is not possible to complete the syllabus fast in a batch or a group teaching mode. I could get my doubts solved swiftly because of the personalized mode. However, that would not have been possible for me, if I was studying elsewhere in a batch or a group. I have given around 200 to 250 Full Syllabus Tests",
          "paragraph3": "What I realized is, in the beginning, the Full Syllabus Tests seem challenging and the scores are usually low, lower than the Part Syllabus Tests. As we keep at them and keep going, analyze our mistakes thoroughly and work on our weak topics and chapters, our scores in FSTs start improving. It is also important to not compare your performance with anyone else’s but with your own previous performance. It is important to balance or eliminate hyper normal stimuli like video gaming, excessive eating, watching videos online, which, if not moderated might be a huge obstacle to the path of preparation",
          "paragraph4": "All along, love the process of learning science and gathering knowledge and try to learn from the mistakes rather than feel bad about the mistakes made in the tests or any low scores. As many problems as possible should be solved and it is also a great idea to solve the same problem set multiple times to become more confident in a chapter or topic",

It allowed the professors to monitor my progress at each step. I received feedback pertaining to my areas of improvement and not just some general feedback that is applicable to everyone. That helped me immensely to focus on my weak areas and strengthen them with time",
          "paragraph2": "Their strategy of early completion of syllabus has provided one of the biggest advantages by giving me 2 years of time only for practice, revision and test series enabling me to constantly improve my scores. The Full Syllabus Tests helped me understand the concepts that I had forgotten with time and also the topics and chapters in which I need to practice more. The professors clarified all my NEET doubts from time to time, making my revision and practice process effective and efficient. Paathshala and Photon Ecademy’s Mistakes Analysis’ Report has been an amazing tool in helping me find out topics and chapters, where I needed more practice and revision. I have given 200 to 250 NEET Full Syllabus Tests. Solving these many FSTs greatly improved my time management skills and also my ability to stay calm and confident in an exam environment",
          "paragraph3": "I would recommend Paathshala and Photon Ecademy’s Educational services to all future aspirants. The personal attention they deliver is the key to success in competitive entrance exams",

          "paragraph3": "<b>Saurabh’s Study Routine</b> – I have been serious about academics since the very beginning. I study everyday since my school days (X Standard, mainly). During my JEE preparation, I used to study and practice questions for at least 5 to 6 hours each and everyday (this is apart from the classes duration). I used to give equal importance to all the three subjects – Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. I was good at Mathematics. Physics was challenging for me, so I used to study Physics for more duration. Whatever used to be taught in the class, I developed the habit of going home and revising it on the same day",
          "paragraph4": "<b>Saurabh’s Tips For JEE Aspirants</b> – When you give your practice tests, make sure to avoid silly mistakes. If this habit is not consciously developed, there is likeliness of losing marks to silly mistakes in the final exam. Every mark is precious. Learn to manage time well. This is a very important skill to be developed and nurtured when you give your Full Syllabus Tests. The professors at Paathshala and Photon Ecademy helped me a lot with gaining the skillset needed to crack the JEE Advanced exam",

Even if your ward has good grasping and understanding abilities, he/she will not be able to ask doubts and will eventually keep those doubts to themselves which will keep piling with time affecting their confidence and morale",

It has been a unique experience. <b>We were taught in a different environment, with a different approach. Also, it is a personalized one-to-one teaching that is provided at Paathshala and Photon Ecademy.</b> It really helped me understand the core concepts of the subjects and that helped me crack the questions in the NEET exam with greater ease",
          "paragraph2": "When we think about a competitive exam like NEET, we students mostly tend to be Biology-oriented.

Most students are unaware of this",

          "paragraph5": "Paathshala and Photon Ecademy’s professors also helped me a lot with Organic Chemistry, which is another challenging subject like Physics. The books I have been suggested for Organic Chemistry practice and the material given to me by Paathshala and Photon Ecademy helped me gain exposure to different types of questions. There were also previous years’ competitive exams’ questions present in the Paathshala and Photon Ecademy practice set. That along with the solved examples helped me a lot. <b>There were some questions, which I can tell you, that were asked in my NEET exam which are, as if directly taken from the Paathshala and Photon Ecademy material. I would like to give credit to the material for it</b>",
          "paragraph6": "<b>Rijushree’s Tips to NEET Aspirants</b> – NEET is a time-oriented exam, so you need to be very well-prepared for the exam. You should know how to crack the questions in a proper order. Read NCERT of every subject very thoroughly to become perfect with the theory aspect of the subjects, including Physics, because sometimes theory questions are also asked in Physics. Solve previous years’ NEET/AIPMT question papers. This is very important. The more you solve, the better will be the exposure you gain to the type of questions asked in the NEET exam. There are many questions that are repeated from previous years’ NEET exams as well. Try not to stick with just one material. Solve as many models of questions as possible. Paathshala and Photon Ecademy gives you access to a variety of amazing and well-curated learning resources, across varying difficulty levels. Make sure your concepts are strong. This will enable you to crack NEET with flying colours. I would like to wish the best to all the NEET aspirants out there and would want them to do very well in the exam and get into their dream medical college in the first attempt itself",
